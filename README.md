# WarhammerSim
A Repository to Simulate Warhammer 40k Combat for Statistical Analysis

## Purpose
I'm god-awful at 40k. To better understand the mechanics of the game as well as create more simulations to practice python, I'm using this repo to create a simulator for 40k.

### dice.py
A warm-up; this does two things. First, it lets you roll the two main dice types in 40k: D6 and D3. The latter is implimented as described in the core rules of 40k. "If a rule requires you to roll a D3, roll a D6 and halve the result (rounding up to a whole number) to get the D3 result." Second, it lets you roll a collection of dice and measures the number of regular and critical successes.
